# Progne Niche Evolution
Code to accompany the manuscript on Progne niche evolution.

The manuscript Appendix1_v2 contains the results and additonal figures associated with the manuscript. Steps for analyzing the data in `nichevol` are also included within this document.

Initial data formatting and steps taken to perform niche analyses are in the included `R` files. Please note that I do not include raw data for the phylogeny or for the climate data here, as these must be downloaded or requested directly from their sources.
